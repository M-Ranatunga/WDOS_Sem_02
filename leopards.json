          "image": "rhabitatloss2.jpg",
          "description": "Habitat loss in Sri Lanka is primarily attributed to deforestation, driven by activities such as logging, agriculture expansion, and infrastructure development. This leads to the fragmentation and degradation of leopard habitats. Consequences include a decline in prey availability, increased human-leopard conflicts as leopards encroach on human settlements in search of food, and a higher risk of inbreeding among isolated leopard populations.<br><br>Efforts to mitigate habitat loss involve establishing protected areas, reforestation initiatives, and sustainable land-use planning. Implementing and enforcing regulations against illegal logging and unauthorized land conversion play a crucial role in conservation."

This trade poses a serious threat to their population, disrupting the ecological balance and biodiversity. It also fuels organized crime networks involved in smuggling and poaching.<br><br>Combatting illegal wildlife trade involves strengthening law enforcement, enhancing border controls, and raising awareness about the consequences of wildlife trafficking. International cooperation and stricter penalties for offenders are crucial in curbing this illicit trade.<br><br>"
