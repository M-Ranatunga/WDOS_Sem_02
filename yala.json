Located to the south east of the island, this exceptional game reserve is Sri Lanka’s most popular for very good reason. Thought to be home to the greatest density of leopards per square kilometre in the world, Yala covers an area of 1,260 square kilometres and is divided into five blocks. Block I is the most visited portion of the reserve and the most rewarding destination for a leopard safari. Leopards are usually elusive, though in Yala, sightings of them are extremely good – you might see them basking in the sun atop rocky outcrops, in trees, crossing tracks and beside waterholes. Alongside leopards, there are also sloth bears, Asian elephants, deer, monkeys, buffalo and many species of birds. If you’re really set on seeing leopards, Yala will offer you Sri Lanka’s best opportunity."
